# Game - Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can choose one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game keeps track of the results and displays them to the user.

## Installation

1. Download the project files to your local machine.

   git clone https://github.com/19Archmiel88/Game---Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on one of the three images (rock, paper, or scissors) to make your selection.

2. Click the "Let's play!" button to see the game's outcome.

3. The game will display the following information:
   - Your choice
   - Computer's choice
   - The game result (win, loss, or draw)

4. The current results are displayed on the right side of the page:
   - Number of games played
   - Number of wins
   - Number of losses
   - Number of draws

5. Enjoy the game and see if you can outsmart the computer!

## Code Overview

The JavaScript code in `game.js` handles the game logic:

- It allows the player to select one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding image.
- The computer's choice is generated randomly.
- The game result (win, loss, or draw) is determined based on the player's and computer's choices.
- The results are displayed on the webpage, and the game statistics are updated.
